### 2. Update the Preloader Code with Your Image URL

3. Replace it with your copied image URL, for example:

   ```
   
   ```

### 3. Add the Custom Code to Wix Dashboard

1. Go to your **Wix Dashboard** (not the Editor).
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Custom Code**.
3. Click **+ New Custom Code**.
4. Paste the entire updated code snippet (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) into the code box.
5. Under **Add Code to Pages**, select **All Pages** (or specific pages if preferred).

### 4. Test Your Preloader

## Customization

- **Background Color:** Change the `background-color` in the CSS `#preloader` selector.
- **Animation Timing:** Adjust the durations in the JavaScript `setTimeout` calls.
- **Particle Colors:** Modify the `colors` array in the JavaScript.
- **Responsive Settings:** Tweak CSS media queries for different screen sizes.

## Troubleshooting

- If the preloader does not appear, verify that the custom code is added to the **Head** section and published.
- Confirm your image URL is correct and publicly accessible.
- Wix Preview mode may not fully support custom code; always test on the **live published site**.
- Clear browser cache if changes do not show immediately.
